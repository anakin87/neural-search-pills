# Neural Search Pills

## Foundational concepts
- [What is Neural Search?](pills/neural-search.md)
- Semantic Search vs Question Answering

## Retrieval
- Sparse and Dense retrieval
- Sparse retrieval: TF-IDF, BM25
- Dense retrieval
- Embedding retrieval: Sentence Transformers
- Retrieve and Re-Rank (Cross-Encoders vs Bi-Encoders)
- Retrieval Evaluation

## Question Answering
- Machine reading at scale (Retriever + Reader)
- Transformer Reader Models
- Question Answering Evaluation
- Generative Question Answering: RAG, LFQA

## Neural Search Ecosystem
- Vector Search
- Document Stores and Vector Databases
- FAISS
- Neural Search Frameworks

## Misc on Neural Search
- Question Answering on Tables
- Question Generation
- GPL: Generative Pseudo Labeling
- CLIP: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training

## Other
- Natural Language Inference models and Zero-Shot Classification
- Model Distillation
